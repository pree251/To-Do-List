# To-Do-List
A to-do list app which will allow you to add the goals you want to accomplish today and then later check them off when you've achieved them! \ It also shows the current date and month at the top so you can keep track of your to-do lists. \ It also includes a "Work List" in case you don't want to mix your personal and work life tasks. \
To the url, just add "/work" in order to access the "Work List".
